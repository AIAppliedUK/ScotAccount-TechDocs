# ScotAccount Technical Documentation

ScotAccount is Scotland's centralised digital identity service that provides government services with secure user authentication and access to verified personal information.

## What ScotAccount Provides

ScotAccount offers two core capabilities for government services:

- **User Authentication** - Verify users have a ScotAccount and receive a persistent user identifier (UUID)
- **Verified Attributes** - Access independently verified identity, address, and email data

All authentication is verified to **GPG45 Medium assurance level** through comprehensive identity verification processes.
